          <h1>The Travaasa Vision</h1>
          <p>Our inspiration for Travaasa began with our own travel — far too often we have stayed in cold, soulless concrete towers that suppressed the magic of a place. For years we searched for an experiential hotel that truly embodied a sense of place — a destination’s culture, its cuisine, its adventures, its sense of well-being. We wanted a place that would reawaken us. Intellectually, culturally, experientially. A place where we could learn, touch and do new things. A place we couldn’t find in our own backyard, or at the local spa or gym. In other words, we wanted the joy of the journey, the magic of arriving somewhere new and getting a sense of that place. We wanted spontaneous moments and the magic of surprise that travel is supposed to bring us — all embodied in a hotel with wonderful amenities.<br><br>
<strong>No such place existed, so we decided to create it.</strong><br><br>
We are more than just destination hotels with world-class spa services, cuisine inspired by local flavor, and breathtaking vistas. Our hotels recapture the magic of travel and give you indelible memories. Travaasa Experiential Resorts embody the best of what happens when you travel: the journey, the discovery of a place, of people, of yourself, of the stories that define your life. <strong>We invite you to join us on the journey.</strong></p>

        <p class="description">Your Travaasa starts the moment you find yourself in a car, winding down a spectacular Texas Hill Country road. The vista unravels like a color-saturated ribbon, leading you to a place unlike any other. The car stops. You have arrived. And what you'll find is an intimate gathering of buildings — a curated amount of lodges. We’re about your experience, your travel – not catering to hundreds of people. <a href="/austin">Travaasa Austin</a></p>

        <p class="description">Travaasa Hana is a destination resort unlike anywhere else in the world. Gracious in every sense of the word, from our staff to accommodations, dining, experiences, scenery and much more. We invite you to discover it for yourself. <a href="/hana">Travaasa Hana</a></p>
