<h2 name="faq1">TRAVAASA WEDDING COMMITMENT</h2>


<h4 id="isacontractrequiredtohaveaweddingattravaasa">Is a contract required to have a wedding at Travaasa?</h4>

<ul>
<li>All weddings require a contract. The contract is between Travaasa and the Responsible Party</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="whatistheguestroomrequirementtohavemyweddingattravaasa">What is the guest room requirement to have my wedding at Travaasa?</h4>

<ul>
<li>Travaasa Events: In order to book a wedding and secure event space at Travaasa a minimum of 8 rooms each night or 15 cumulative room nights are required as part of your contract. Please keep in mind that Travaasa does not allow minors under the age of 16 on the grounds.</li>
<li>Property Buy-Out: An exclusive buy-out of the property allows you and your guests’ unlimited access to the grounds. A buy-out requires a signed contract for all 70-guest rooms with a two night minimum stay (must include the night of the event). Children are permitted during the hours of the buy-out; beginning at 3 p.m. on the arrival date and ending at 12 p.m. on departure day. Minors are not allowed on property outside of those time periods. Buy-outs also require a Food &amp; Beverage Minimum Revenue and a Spa Minimum Revenue.</li>
<li>Farm Events: Weddings booked at the Travaasa Farm do not require guests rooms and minors are allowed at the Farm with appropriate adult supervision.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="whathappensifalloftheroomswecontractarenotreserved">What happens if all of the rooms we contract are not reserved?</h4>

<ul>
<li>Buy-Outs are required to book all 70-guest rooms each night. If all 70 are not reserved the Responsible Party will be responsible for paying for the remainder.</li>
<li>Non buy-out contracts will have a cut-off date by which your guests must make their reservations. At that time, based on the total number of rooms contracted, you will have the opportunity to reduce your block by 10%. If there are still unreserved rooms after the reduction you will be responsible for payment for the unoccupied rooms.</li>
</ul>

<h2 name="faq2">CEREMONY/ RECEPTION</h2>

<h4 id="isthereanon-siteweddingcoordinator">Is there an on-site wedding coordinator?</h4>

<ul>
<li>As the selected venue for your wedding ceremony and/or reception Travaasa will provide expert assistance with food and beverage service and set up of all included items in the Travaasa Event Fee. Your event will be assigned a Venue Coordinator who will provide a detailed questionnaire to assist in your menu selections, set up requirements, proposed timeline, and vendor requirements. The Venue Coordinator will assist in ensuring that you have met all of your contractual obligations to the hotel and offer suggestions on how best to utilize the venue.</li>
<li>Travaasa recommends that you work with a professional wedding planner to assist in planning your ceremony &amp; reception, facilitation of the ceremony rehearsal, finding outside vendors for needs beyond the inclusions of the hotel, and to orchestrate coordination the day of your ceremony and reception. Please note that a professional wedding planner is required when buying out the hotel for an exclusive wedding.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="whathappensifitrains">What happens if it rains?</h4>

<ul>
<li>A rain back-up plan should be decided upon during the booking phase of the wedding. Due to the make-up of the facility, not all venues within the property offer a rain backup at your selected site (i.e. the farm). Any additional costs including tenting, outdoor flooring, umbrellas, heaters, etc. are at the discretion of the weddng party and will incur additional costs.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="willibeallowedtohaveaceremonyrehearsal">Will I be allowed to have a ceremony rehearsal?</h4>

<ul>
<li>Yes! A date and time for your wedding rehearsal will be scheduled and typically takes place the day before the event.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="whencanihaveaccesstostartsettingupmydcor">When can I have access to start setting up my décor?</h4>

<ul>

</ul>

<h4 id="isoutsidecateringallowed">Is outside catering allowed?</h4>

Travaasa recommends cake deliveries happen 2&#8211;3 hours prior to start of reception. Cakes should be delivered and assembled at final display location by cake vendor. We recommend cakes displayed in outdoor venues feature fondant icing in order to maintain integrity of cakes.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="howcanifigureoutanaverageperpersoncostformyreception">How can I figure out an average per person cost for my reception?</h4>

<h4 id="whyaremymenuandbarpricessomuchhigherthanifiworkdirectlywithacatererorbuymyownalcohol">Why are my menu and bar prices so much higher than if I work directly with a caterer or buy my own alcohol?</h4>

<ul>
<li>As a full service event facility we try to offer the simplest pricing structure possible. In doing so we provide pricing for food and beverages that are inclusive of the equipment necessary to deliver those services. For example, Travaasa will not charge a separate rental fee for tables, chairs, china, silver, or glassware required to deliver your menu (a caterer will offer pricing for just food with additional rental prices noted for the equipment.)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="amirequiredtotipontopoftheservicechargewhyareservicechargestaxed">Am I required to tip on top of the service charge? Why are service charges taxed?</h4>

In order to use the pool exclusively it is required to buy-out the spa during the time you wish to use the space.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="doservicesacquiredbymyguestscounttowardstheminimumrequirement">Do services acquired by my guests count towards the minimum requirement?</h4>

<ul>
<li>Spa services acquired by guests can be applied towards any contracted spa minimum as long as the services are rendered during the contracted event period. Spa revenue cannot be applied towards other commitments such as food &amp; beverage minimums or room rental commitments.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="whathappensifsomeonecancelstheirspaorno-showsfortheirappointment">What happens if someone cancels their spa or no-shows for their appointment?</h4>

<ul>
<li>If a guest cancels their spa or no-shows the charges for the spa appointment will be charged to the Responsible Party unless the individual provided a form of payment at the time of booking the appointment.
