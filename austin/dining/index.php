          <h1>DINING AT TRAVAASA AUSTIN</h1>
          <p>Our culinary staff is obsessed with two things: nourishing our guests with delicious dishes composed of fresh, organic, and locally sourced ingredients whenever possible; and fostering a sense of community at the table. It is these two obsessions that make dining at Travaasa Austin so special.</p>
<p>In fact, we named our restaurant Jean's Kitchen, after the mother of one of our founders. <a href="./jean-berry">Jean Berry</a> was known to say that sharing your day’s story over the kitchen table was always the most magical time of the day. Our executive chef, Benjamin Baker, has taken great strides to not only live up to Jean’s awesome cooking, but to deliver an experience where guests can share their story over breakfast, lunch or dinner.</p>
<p>Dining is included in some packages at Travaasa Austin. See our <a href="/austin/rates-and-packages">rates &amp; packages</a> for more.</p>

    <p><strong>Executive Chef, Benjamin Baker</strong><br>When Chef Benjamin Baker accepted the position as executive chef at Travaasa, he brought the tools he valued most to his new job—a good attitude, a set of knives and a 167-year-old sourdough starter. With his passion for baking breads and pastries and a dedication to seasonal, organic and local ingredients, Chef Baker is revolutionizing Travaasa cuisine.</p>
<p>Modestly, he gives credit to his sourdough starter that is used in many of his baked goods, but after cooking in kitchens from Maui, HI, to San Jose, CA, to Austin, TX, Baker’s two decades of experience have resulted in a distinctive and celebrated culinary style winning raves at Travaasa.</p>
<p>"I love nourishing people and introducing our guests to new flavors in a creative way,” said Baker. “We’re celebrating food in its most natural form with an emphasis on organic, seasonal and local ingredients."</p>
